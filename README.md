# ARS_Lung_Microbiome

Welcome reviewers,

This is the R code for data analysis of 16S sequencing data.

Here are the code for 
- Lung microbiome in C57BL6 background
- Lung microbiome in DBA background

Each directory contains a Rstudio project.
Downloading them and then running (mindlessly) the main Script should lead to the expected outputs.

Have fun !
